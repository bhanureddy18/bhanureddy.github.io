<h1>Tutorial - Person Detection for social Distnacing using Deep Learning</h1>
<h1>Introduction </h1>
<p>
Coronavirus is a large family virus that harms humans and animals. Covid-19 is known as a family member of coronavirus, first spread to Wuhan, China in December 2019. The outbreak then rapidly affected many countries in the world and had been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Based on the information from WHO, the coronavirus is spreading from a person to a person via small droplets from the nose and mouth. In other words, social distancing is the best practice where people can minimize physical contact with possible coronavirus carriers, by keeping the distance at least one meter away from each other.
The project “Person Detection for Social Distancing” is proposed to support the actions on Covid-19 spread mitigation. It provides a solution for detecting people gathering in public places such as banks, shopping malls, clinics etc. The concept of person detection algorithm is used to accurately detect a person’s presence in areas of interest and is then followed by measuring the distance between the detected persons.

<h1>Existing System </h1>
<p>
Since the novel coronavirus pandemic began, many countries have been taking the help of technology based solutions in different capacities to contain the outbreak. Many developed countries, including India and South Korea, for instance, utilizing GPS to track the movements of the suspected or infected persons to monitor any possibility of their exposure among healthy people. In India, the government is using Arogya Setu app, which works with the help of GPS and Bluetooth to locate the presence of Covid-19 patients in vicinity area. It also helps others to keep safe distance from the infected person.
On the other hand, some law enforcement departments have been using drones and other surveillance cameras to detect mass gatherings of people, and taking regulatory actions to disperse the crowd. Human detection using visual surveillance system is an established area of research which is relying upon manual methods of identifying unusual activities. However, it has limited capabilities.
 
<h2>Problems in existing system</h2>
<p>
•	Time Consuming
•	Brings a unique set of threats to the public and is challenging to the workforce

<h1>Proposed System</h1>
<p>
In the proposed system, a deep learning based framework is proposed that utilizes object detection and tracking models to aid in the social distancing remedy for dealing with the escalation of Covid-19 cases. In order to maintain the balance of speed and accuracy, SSD (Single Shot Detector) algorithm is utilized as object detection and tracking approaches while surrounding each detected object with the bounding boxes.
Later, these bounding boxes are utilized to compute the pair wise L2 norm with computationally efficient vectorized representation for identifying the clusters of people not obeying the order of social distancing.

<h1>	Benefits of Proposed System</h1>
<p>
•	Reduces the transmission of viruses by following a non-pharmaceutical way
•	Time saving
•	User friendly
